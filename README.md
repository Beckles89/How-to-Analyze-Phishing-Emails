# Phishing Email Analysis in VirtualBox

## üìå Overview
This repository documents the process of safely analyzing phishing emails inside an **isolated Virtual Machine** running in **VirtualBox**.  
The goal is to simulate a secure analysis environment to investigate suspicious emails without risking the host system.

---

## üõ† Tools & Technologies Used
- **VirtualBox** ‚Äì Virtualization platform
- **Ubuntu / Kali Linux VM** ‚Äì Analysis operating system
- **Thunderbird / Evolution Mail Client** ‚Äì Email inspection
- **Wireshark** ‚Äì Network monitoring
- **PhishTool / Email Header Analyzer** ‚Äì Header and metadata analysis
- **ClamAV** ‚Äì Malware scanning
- **VirusTotal** ‚Äì Online malware scanning and file analysis
- **OLEtools / PDFid** ‚Äì Attachment analysis
- **Python** (optional) ‚Äì Script-based email parsing

---

## üñ• Virtual Machine Setup

### 1. Install VirtualBox
- Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) on your host machine.

### 2. Create a New Virtual Machine
- Select **Linux ‚Üí Ubuntu 64-bit** or **Kali Linux**.
- Allocate at least:
  - **RAM:** 4 GB  
  - **CPU:** 2 cores  
  - **Disk Space:** 25 GB

### 3. Networking Configuration
- Use **NAT Network** or **Host-Only Adapter** to prevent direct exposure to the internet.
- This ensures the VM is **isolated** from the host and external networks.

## üì• Installing Email Analysis Tools

Inside the VM:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install thunderbird wireshark clamav python3-pip -y
pip3 install extract-msg
````

Optional security tools:

```bash
sudo apt install oletools pdfid
```

## üìß Analyzing a Phishing Email

### Step 1: Open Email Safely

* Import the **.eml** file into Thunderbird.
* DO NOT click any links or download attachments without scanning first.

### Step 2: Examine Email Headers

* Use **View ‚Üí Headers ‚Üí All** in Thunderbird.
* Look for:

  * **"From" address** vs **Return-Path** mismatch
  * **Received** path anomalies
  * **SPF/DKIM/DMARC** failures

### Step 3: Check Links

* Hover over links (DO NOT CLICK).
* Copy and paste into a safe link scanner such as [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) or [URLScan.io](https://urlscan.io).

### Step 4: Analyze Attachments

* Save attachments to a test folder inside the VM.
* Scan with ClamAV:

  ```bash
  clamscan suspicious_file
  ```
* For Office documents:

  ```bash
  olevba suspicious.doc
  ```
* For PDFs:

  ```bash
  pdfid suspicious.pdf
  ```

### Step 5: Monitor Network Activity

* Use Wireshark to watch outbound connections when opening files in a sandbox.
* Filter suspicious traffic (`http`, `dns`, `tcp.port==443`).
